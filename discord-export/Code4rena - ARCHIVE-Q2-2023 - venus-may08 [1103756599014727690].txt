yes, it has been already audited by Hacken and Certik. Moreover, Peckshield did an initial audit of this update

right. They shared the preliminary reports with the team and we fixed everything we considered appropriate. These audit reports are not still public, and they won't be revealed during the contest

There will be a section with "Publicly Known Issues" in the github repo, with the points/issues we assume, and that will be ineligible for awards. Some of these issues were identified in the already-done audits

Could you please define what `snapshot.shortfall  `  is, in the context of the ` function _checkRedeemAllowed(` function ?


[05/09/2023 21:20] infectedfuture
Hi, what do you mean by "isolated" pools, in comparison to Compound ? From my understanding, in Compound each market is isolated from each other


[05/09/2023 21:23] infectedfuture
Or is it because in Compound, a user can borrow assets from a MarketA, with assets he deposited in a MarketB?


[05/09/2023 21:52] daureos (pinned)
in Venus Isolated Pool there are several pools, and in each pool there are several markets. For example, let's say we have:

Pool 1, with a market for WBNB and a market for USDT
Pool 2, with a market for RiskyCoinA and a market for RiskyCoinB

you will be able to deposit USDT in the pool 1 and borrow WBNB in the pool 1, using the deposited USDT as collateral

due to the isolation, you won't be able to borrow RiskyCoinA in the pool 2 using the USDT deposited in the pool 1. You will have to deposit RiskyCoinB in the pool 2 to borrow some RiskyCoinA in the pool 2

this way, users will be able to have several open positions assuming different risks, reducing the propagation risk (if RiskyCoinB price goes down, your WBNB position in the pool 1 won't be liquidated, for example, because it's covered only by funds deposited in the pool 1)

Hi there @narayanprusty, you match my time zone ☺️ 

Can you provide any context on the price oracle. I know it is out of scope but I need it to know how it affects this function I'm examining


[05/11/2023 11:48] narayanprusty
We have built a Resilient Oracle. It allows us to set different price sources for each asset. Each price source for each asset can be classified as either main, pivot or fallback. Right now our resilient oracle supports Binance, Chainlink, Pyth and PancakeSwap price sources


[05/11/2023 11:49] narayanprusty
Validation flow:
     * - Validate price from main oracle against pivot oracle. If valid returns main oracle price
     * - Validate price from fallback oracle against pivot oracle if the first validation failed. In this case fallback oracle price is returned.
     * - Validate price from main oracle against fallback oracle if the second validation failed. In this case main oracle price is returned.


[05/11/2023 11:49] narayanprusty
* - In the case that the pivot oracle is not available but main price is available and validation is successful, main oracle price is returned.


[05/11/2023 11:50] narayanprusty
We use a bound validator to validate price between two sources. In this we can configure upper and lower bound ratio for an asset for validation.


[05/11/2023 11:54] d_auditor
Thanks. That was helpful

So for that contest Oracle issues are out of scope?


[05/11/2023 12:00] zaevlad
And oracles should be trusted?


[05/11/2023 12:07] narayanprusty
Yes oracle is out of scope. You can assume oracle price is always correct.

If you mean unit tests, we are using a mocking library to lovk dependencies of the contracts and also to mock return values.

Hello, where is the access control set for each function?


[05/11/2023 19:29] kkirka_
Access controls are configured by governance, which can, with a community vote, assign permissions to other actors. The repository with the governance and access control contracts is here: https://github.com/venusprotocol/governance-contracts/. This repo is out of the scope for the audit, so you can assume that access control only grants permissons to trusted entities (usually community-managed timelock contracts with different delays).

@narayanprusty DMed you. Pls check when you got time. Thx


[05/11/2023 20:16] co0nan
is there a way to unlist market? I see addMarket but there is no way to delete a market or set the `isListed` to false


[05/11/2023 20:57] berlin.101
I think it can be "deprecated". Check: "isDeprecated" in Comptroller.sol.


[05/11/2023 21:00] co0nan
I din't think this is what i'm looking for. Most preHook functions has a check `if(!markets[vToken].isListed)` but as I can see, there is no way to set `markets[vToken].isListed = false.`


[05/11/2023 21:02] berlin.101
True that. Only the ComptrollerScenerio.sol used for tests has "unlist" function.


[05/11/2023 21:06] 0xjmaria
DMed you ser. question about this


[05/11/2023 21:47] troublor
I think `markets[vToken].isListed` defaults to false so if some caller gives a `vToken` that is never been added to the pool. The check will fail. No way to set `markets[vToken].isListed = false` makes sense to me.


[05/11/2023 22:28] 0xjmaria
Exactly

what is `weightedCollateral`


[05/12/2023 09:35] 0xepley
its linked to weight of `asset`, but what is that?


[05/12/2023 09:42] daureos
each "snapshot function" do different calculations, using different parameters. Let us know if you have a specific doubt about them, please


[05/12/2023 09:55] neon2835
Does Venus Protocol Isolated Pools no longer have the concept of stable currency (VAI)？


[05/12/2023 09:57] daureos
it's the value in USD of the collateral deposited by the user, adjusted with the collateral factor, or with the liquidation threshold, depending on the flow. Example:

let's say you have 100 BNB deposited, and enabled to be used as collateral. Let's assume that the collateral factor in the BNB market is 70%, and the liquidation threshold is 80%. And let's assume 1 BNB = $300

when you want to borrow (let's say BTC), covering the borrow with your deposited BNB, the protocol calculates the value of your collateral in USD -> 100 * 300 * 0.7 = $21,000 <- this is the `weightedCollateral`. This will be used as the maximum amount of BTC (in $) you will be allowed to borrow

during a liquidation evaluation, there is a similar calculation, but in this case using the liquidation threshold -> 100 * 300 * 0.8 = $24,000 <- this is the `weightedCollateral`. If your total debt is bigger than this amount, then you will be eligible to be liquidated

~~[updated: liquidation threshold must be always > collateral factor]~~
**[updated 2: liquidation threshold must be always >= collateral factor]**

Not sure about this : markets in an isolated pool share a common Risk Fund and Share Reserve ?

~~initially~~, there will be one RiskFund contract instance and one ProtocolShareReserve instance, used by the different pools/comptrollers

{Reactions}

[05/12/2023 17:17] infectedfuture
Then after this initial period, this will be as i've described it? 
Or should we apply to one RiskFund/ProtocolSR shared by all pools?

Hi, use the extensions 'solidity and hardhat support by hardhat team' + 'solidity visual developer', disable the old ones
If you want to use solidity by juanblanco, maybe it's better to use Mythx extension as well

I believe it takes like 2 months until the final report is released to the public, but if you have the backstage role I understand that you can see the whole judging process

Had a good time auditing this one. Super responsive team. Being able to contact devs in different timezones was huge plus. Wishing the team at Venus all the best. 💯

great content


[05/16/2023 02:11] qpzm
The deadline is over, but why should I  divide by `marketBorrowIndex`  to calculate `borrowAmount`? 
I am confused 😅
```solidity
uint256 borrowAmount = div_(VToken(vToken).totalBorrows(), marketBorrowIndex);
```

[05/16/2023 04:02] PrasadLak#0622
I may completely wrong with this one. Anyway I need to send this. I didn't submit this since I dont have enough time to check all these.


[05/16/2023 04:03] PrasadLak#0622
Take a flash loan > increase the underlying token price >So starting bid decreased. Now Start auction >  Put a bid with startingBid as 0 > wait 30 sec to finish > close the auction > get the tokens for free


[05/16/2023 05:07] __melonwater
they said oracle price is always correct, so I guess the price will not be easily manipulated?


[05/16/2023 09:08] daureos
> increase the underlying token price

I think that using Chainlink or Binance oracles, the protocol should be protected against price manipulation with flash loans. But we are totally open to listening to more about this potential attack vector 🙂

[05/16/2023 10:41] narayanprusty
we are dividing the totalBorrows with borrowIndex so that we only give rewards for total borrows and not the interest accrued on borrows.


[05/16/2023 10:42] qpzm
I understand. Thank you for your response!

Hi. does anyone know the Venus review is completed by sponsor team or not.

35            address asset;
36            uint8 decimals;

38            string symbol;
39            InterestRateModels rateModel; (enum)
40            uint256 baseRatePerYear;
41            uint256 multiplierPerYear;

It is 18 slots. `asset` and `decimals` take up one slot, the rest takes one slot each.

There is `user-defined(null):accessControlManager` in the bot report's ordering, probably the bot didn't know what it is and took it as zero bytes.

In the listing at https://code4rena.com/contests/2023-05-venus-protocol-isolated-pools, it looks like 4th place "DeliChainSec (@deliriusz & @0xffchain)" is missing even though it was present in the rewards pasted in this channel. Curious why that is?
